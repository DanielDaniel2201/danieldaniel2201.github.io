# Boot xv6 (easy)

This part is quite straighforward, just follow the commands and everything is fine  (for Ubuntu20.04 in VMware). 

# sleep (easy)

## Ideal result

```
$ make qemu
...
init: starting sh
$ sleep 10
(nothing happens for a little while)
$
```

## Tips

- Make sure to check the validity of user arguments.
- Note that `argv` comes as an array of string.
- Call syscall `sleep()`.

## My implementation

```c
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  if (argc == 1) { // check validity
    fprintf(2, "Error: an argument is needed.\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  int sleep_time = atoi(argv[1]); // convert string to integer
  sleep(sleep_time); // call syscall

  exit(0);
}
```

# pingpong (easy)

## Ideal result

```
$ make qemu
...
init: starting sh
$ pingpong
4: received ping
3: received pong
$
```

## Tips

- To realize 2-way communication 2 pipes are needed.
- Be clear about the order of `read()` and `write()` in parent and child process.

# My implementation

```c
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int p0[2];
  int p1[2];
  pipe(p0); // child to parent
  pipe(p1); // parent to child

  if (fork() == 0) { // create child process
    char* buf[5];
    close(p0[0]); // close unnecessary file descriptors
    close(p1[1]);
    read(p1[0], buf, 5);
    printf("%d: received %s\n", getpid(), buf);
    write(p0[1], "pong", 4);

  } else {
    char* buf[5];
    close(p0[1]); // close unnecessary file descriptors
    close(p1[0]);
    write(p1[1], "ping", 4);
    read(p0[0], buf, 5);
    printf("%d: received %s\n", getpid(), buf);
    
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

# primes (moderate/hard)

## Ideal result

```
$ make qemu
...
init: starting sh
$ primes
prime 2
prime 3
prime 5
prime 7
prime 11
prime 13
prime 17
prime 19
prime 23
prime 29
prime 31
$
```

## Tips

- Loop is needed and be careful with the condition.
- Store desired values in file descriptors.
- Resue pipes (or not).

## My implementation

```c
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int p[2];
  pipe(p); // create a pipe; 0 - read, 1 - write

  for (int i = 2; i < 36; i++) {
    write(p[1], &i, 4); // write 2, 3, 4, ..., 35 to file descriptor p[1]
  }

  close(p[1]); // having written the integers, close it
  int read_df = p[0]; // read_df is assigned the file descriptor for the read end of pipe1

  int curr_num, next_num;
  while(read(read_df, &curr_num, 4) > 0) { // check "lefet neighbor still has contents"
    printf("prime %d\n", curr_num); // print the prime
    pipe(p);  // pipe2 created
    if (fork() != 0) {
      close(p[0]);
      while (read(read_df, &next_num, 4) > 0) {
        if (next_num % curr_num != 0) { // filter integer for the next round of sieve
          write(p[1], &next_num, 4);
        }
      }
      close(read_df);
      close(p[1]);
      wait((int *)0);
    } else {
      close(p[1]);
      read_df = p[0]; // transform "right neighbor" of this round to "left neighbot" of next round
    }
  }
  exit(0);
}
```

Explanation of the implementation:
main idea: 2 pipes are created, which are used in turns representing "left neighbor" and "right neighbor".
1. With ```pipe(p)``` the first pipe is created (named, say pipe1) and then filled with integers from 2 to 35 with a for loop. Then pipe1's write end is closed which means no more writes to pipe1 and a variable ```read_df``` is assigned the value of the file descriptor for the read end of pipe1. Now pipe1 can only be read.
2. ```curr_num```, ```next_num``` are created for print operation and comparison operation.
3. A while loop is created with condition being that pipe1 still contains integers to be read (if no more integers, read reaches the end and time to exit).
4. Print the first value from "left neighbor" as suggested.
5. With ```pipe(p)``` the second pipe is created (named, say pipe2), which later will be used to store sequence of integers with multiples of something (some number) eliminated.
6. Fork. In the parent process, as long as "left neighbor" has something to be read, integers except multiples of curr_num will be written into pipe2. With ```close(read_df)``` we discard pipe1 where integers from 2 to 35 are stored . In child process ```read_df``` is set to the file descriptor for read end of pipe2 (the "right neighbor" in the first round of sieve is being prepared to be the "left neighbor" in the second round).
7. repeat 4 ~ 6 until after printing the last prime (meaning no more integers after this prime in the pipe) the following newly created pipe won't be written anything into. In the child process ```read_df``` will be assigned a file descriptor for an empty pipe, and later this will cause the next condition checking to fail and then exit.
